# curses-benchmark

## Overview

This program writes random characters to fill the terminal screen, and reports on the resulting "frame rate". This is essentially a benchmark for a text terminal using ncurses, but mostly serves as a quick demo of ncurses programming on OS X and linux.

## Usage

```
curses-benchmark [options]
Options:
-c   use color
-h   show this help
```
