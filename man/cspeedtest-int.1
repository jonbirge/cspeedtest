.SH NAME
.PP
cspeedtest-int - clientless network speed test running interactively
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
cspeedtest-int [\f[I]options\f[R]] \&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
cspeedtest is a command-line program that runs remotely on a server and
measures network speed between a local terminal and that server.
This allows one to measure network speed without having to install
client software on every machine from which you connect.
In addition, it provides a measure of network speed between you and your
server, not between your server and some third-party server.
.PP
Usage is fairly simple.
Just running
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cspeedtest >> log.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Runs a short seven second test and logs the value to a file.
Output goes to \f[I]stdout\f[R] by default.
.PP
The way cspeedtest measures network speed is by using the ncurses
library to send screens full of random characters to the local terminal
as fast as the local terminal will allow, and measuring the resulting
framerate.
This works because terminals have a feedback mechanism to the server
that indicates when the terminal is ready to handle more data.
Random characters are used to avoid compression effects impacting the
estimation of bitrate (ncurses uses compression when sending screens to
the local terminal).
.PP
Because this relies on ncurses, it will only work on terminals which
support ANSI escape sequences.
This includes most modern terminals, but not all.
It has been tested on xterm and gnome-terminal on Linux, on the Mac OS X
Terminal, and on the Windows Command Prompt.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-h, --help
Show a brief help message and exit.
.TP
-g, --graph
Show a live graph of the measurements.
.TP
-b, --low-bw
Low bandwidth mode.
This mode is useful for measuring network speed over a slow connection.
It uses less data per screen to allow for a reasonable update rate.
.TP
-V, --version
Show version information and exit.
.TP
-v, --verbose
Show debugging information.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cspeedtest-int >> log.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Measure network speed and log the value to a file.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
cspeedtest writes certain diagnostics to \f[I]stderr\f[R].
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
cspeedtest exits with a status of 0 if it completes successfully.
Otherwise, it exits with a status of 1.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
cspeedtest does not use any environment variables.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
May not provide accurate measurements over fast connections, as
eventually the throughput becomes limited by the terminal speed and not
the network.
It does, however, provide a fairly good lower bound on the network
speed.
